# Quantum Chess AI

Welcome to the Quantum Chess AI repository! This project explores the fusion of quantum computing and chess to create a powerful AI opponent. Our aim is to leverage quantum algorithms to enhance strategic decision-making in the game of chess.

## Features

- Quantum-based chess engine
- Advanced board evaluation using quantum parallelism
- Configurable difficulty levels
- Interactive gameplay with the quantum AI
- Extensive documentation for understanding the quantum algorithms used

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Quantum Chess AI and start playing against the quantum-powered opponent.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Quantum computing framework (e.g., Qiskit, Cirq)
- Chessboard and pieces
